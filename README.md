If you are testing TP_2 specifically, you will see that a _*...poly.py_ file appear after execution. If you execute it
from shell or cmd, a scatterplot of the initial input will appear together with the graph of the interpolated polynomial
function. However, you might need to install **Python**, as well as the **numpy**, **sympy**, and
**matplotlib** libraries
